# SpawnersV2

Similar to the V1 on my old account, except this one has values to the spawner. 

These values are mostly meant for servers like factions / skyblock that wish to have add value to their island/claims with spawner

TODO:
- [ ] Spawner Stacking
- [ ] Optional cost to mine
- [ ] More entities 
- [ ] fix bug where if you have spawners in inventory and rejoin / restart the server the spawner blocks stop working.
